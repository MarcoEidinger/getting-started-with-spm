# trySwift - Getting Started with SwiftPM by Marco Eidinger (2022)

Examples and reference material for my workshop.

> Learn how to create and organize reusable Swift code for sharing it across Xcode projects and with other developers. This hands-on workshop provides a fundamental understanding of the Swift Package Manager, Swift packages, and its ecosystem. You'll learn how to build, test, document, and deploy Swift packages, use them in your Xcode projects and deal with updates as an author and consumer. I'll share many tips & tricks, including troubleshooting and how to promote and share your work through package registries.

> Join this beginner-friendly workshop if you want to get started creating and distributing libraries or executables with Swift Package Manager. You should have basic Swift and Xcode experience and be comfortable using the terminal and a git-based hosting site like GitHub.
